## Catalan Numbers Applications
Just like fibonacci series we have two initial valies c0=1 and c1=1   
The general formula for nth catalon number is Cn = C0Cn-1 + C1Cn-2 + ..... + Cn-1C0   
Summatiom of indexes of both numbers of a term is always n-1   

### Application of Catalon Numbers
* No of BST with 'n' nodes
* No of unlabeld trees with 'n' nodes
* 'n' parenthesis (with or without letters), There are 'n pair of parentheis, find the no of valid representations
* Dyck words - we have 'n' Xs and 'n' Ys, we have to find no of XY arrangements such that at no point no of Y should be grteater than no of X
* Mountain ranges, we have n pair of /\, no of ways to arrange them for getting valid mountains
* Path on Grid , Grid is given with N rows and N columns. No of ways to go frm the bottom left to the top right so that always we will remian  below the diagonal or always above the diagonal
* Convex polygon, we are given a polygon of N sides. No of ways in which we can convert it into triangles.
* Disjoint chords in circle, we are given N pair of points on a circle, no of ways we can draw n disjoint chords
